A short history of the company
</p>
<p>
World Wide Spam was started in the summer of 2000. The business 
concept was to ride the dot-com wave and to make money both through
bulk email and by selling canned meat online.
</p>
<p>
After receiving several complaints from customers who weren't
satisfied by their bulk email. World Wide Spam altered their profile,
and focused 100% on canned goods. Today, They rank as the world's
13.892nd online supplier or SPAM.
